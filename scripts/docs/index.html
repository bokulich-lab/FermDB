This yogurt is not strained and is considered one of the most representative fermented foods from Bulgaria.","Ergo is a traditional milk product that undergoes spontaneous fermentation, bearing some resemblance to yogurt. It possesses a thick, smooth, and uniform texture, usually presenting as white when carefully prepared. This semi-solid product carries a pleasant aroma and taste. Ergo serves as a primary sour milk product, laying the foundation for the production of other dairy items. Smallholder farmers across all regions of Ethiopia produce Ergo from raw cow milk, while in lowland regions, relatively smaller quantities are made from goat and camel milk. As the main fermented dairy product, Ergo is widely popular and consumed throughout the country by every member of the family.","Viili is a traditional Finnish fermented milk product that is often classified as a yogurt. The traditional form of viili is thick and stringy, unlike store-bought, creamy varieties. Although viili is nowadays mostly associated with Finland, it most likely originated in Sweden, where it is known as filbunke. \r\nTo produce viili, milk is inoculated with a starter and left to incubate at around 20 °C for 16–24 hours. The viili starter contains slime-forming mesophilic lactic acid bacteria . This slime contributes to the ropy texture of viili, and the bacteria secrete extracellular polysaccharides (EPSs) that create the slime.","Nunu is a naturally fermented milk product similar to yoghurt, originating from Ghana and extending to other West African regions like Nigeria and Burkina Faso. Distinct from various other African fermented milk items derived from goats, sheep, or camels, Nunu exclusively is produced from cow's milk. Traditionally, the fresh milk is collected and left to ferment at room temperature for a day or two. Nunu has a yoghurt-like flavor profile with a tangy acidity. Similar to numerous spontaneously fermented foods across Africa, Nunu's production primarily occurs within households, and its fermentation process is spontaneous.","Ayran is the traditional yogurt drink popular in many countries across Europe and Asia. It is a semi-solid fermented milk product. For its production cow, sheep or goat milk are used. At the beginning the milk is boiled, then it is cooled to 30-35 °C and a starter culture for the fermentation is added. The fermentation lasts 7-10 hours at room temperature.
