Europe	Western Europe (155)	040	Austria		cheese - dairy product	Bregenzerwälder Bergkäse	"Bregenzerwälder or Vorarlberger mountain cheese is produced in the Alpine region of Bregenzerwald in Austria’s most western province, Vorarlberg, and is entirely made from whole or partly skimmed raw milk. The evening milk is traditionally stored in holzgepsen (large wooden vats) and remains there over night without chilling, which keeps the natural raw milk microflora intact. The mountain cheese is then stored and aged under constant care for up to two years. Traditionally the cows from which the milk for this cheese is used are entirely fed with fresh grass or hay. No silage is used. Farmers are encouraged to keep the amount of concentrated feed at an absolute minimum. The most important aspects of traditional Bregenzerwälder mountain cheese production are that the milk storage in wooden containers without chilling over night keeps the raw milk microflora intact and has a positive effect on the maturation process, making the purchase of bacterial cultures from the lab unnecessary as the required starter cultures for cheese production are used over and over again. https://www.fondazioneslowfood.com/en/ark-of-taste-slow-food/bregenzerwalder-mountain-cheese/"	cow milk 	raw cow milk	"Quijada, N.

Each type of baijiu uses a distinct type of Qū for fermentation unique to the distillery for the distinct and characteristic flavour profile. The production process of Chinese Baijiu involves a complex fermentation system with various microorganisms and a variety of raw grains like sorghum, rice, wheat, or millet. Unique fermentation technology is employed to process these grains. Baijiu is typically produced through natural solid-state fermentation, where different microbial species, including yeasts, bacteria, and molds, work simultaneously to saccharify and ferment the grains. This contributes to the diverse flavor types and complex characteristics found in this product."
