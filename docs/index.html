* Description:
Overview for a non-expert. (1) Overall description of the food (2) Particularities of the production; and (3) Particularities of location of production or geographic distribution.

* Raw material ontology:
This classification is based exclusively on raw materials on a semi-organismic level while excluding processing information.

* Raw material additional information:
Details about the raw materials that are not captured in the ontology. It includes any details related to the particularities of an ingredient.

* Category:
Each food is assigned to one general fermented food category:  acid beverage, alcoholic beverage, beer, cheese, condiment, dairy product, fermented cereal, fermented fish, fermented fruit, fermented legumes, fermented meat, fermented roots, fermented vegetables, or wine.
