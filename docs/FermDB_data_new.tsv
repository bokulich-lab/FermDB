The production process of Chinese Baijiu involves a complex fermentation system with various microorganisms and a variety of raw grains like sorghum,rice,wheat,or millet. Unique fermentation technology is employed to process these grains. Baijiu is typically produced through natural solid-state fermentation,where different microbial species,including yeasts,bacteria,and molds,work simultaneously to  ferment the grains.

It is made only during the summer mountain grazing,from June to September,starting from the raw milk of the Tarentaise and Abondance cows,who graze on herbs and flowers. This is one of the rare cheeses where the curd is broken and has natural blue veins,in contrast to other blue cheeses,which are injected with spores of penicillium. There are currently less than ten producers  whose herds include no more than 60 animals. This is a little known cheese with a brown-ochre rind.	cow milk 	cow milk	Les fromages d'alpage de la ferme de Chavières. (n.d.).

Europe	Western Europe		Austria	040	cheese	Bregenzerwalder Mountain Cheese	Bregenzerwälder Bergkäse,Vorarlberger Bergkäse 	Bregenzerwälder or Vorarlberger mountain cheese is produced in the Alpine region of Bregenzerwald in Austria’s most western province,Vorarlberg,and is entirely made from whole or partly skimmed raw milk. The evening milk is traditionally stored in holzgepsen (large wooden vats) and remains there overnight without chilling,which keeps the natural raw milk microflora intact. The mountain cheese is then stored and aged under constant care for up to two years. Traditionally the cows from which the milk for this cheese is used are entirely fed with fresh grass or hay. No silage is used. Farmers are encouraged to keep the amount of concentrated feed at an absolute minimum. The most important aspects of traditional Bregenzerwälder mountain cheese production are that the milk storage in wooden containers without chilling overnight keeps the raw milk microflora intact and has a positive effect on the maturation process,making the purchase of bacterial cultures from the lab unnecessary as the required starter cultures for cheese production are used over and over again. 	cow milk 	raw cow milk	Quijada,N.

After indicatively 15 days,the cheese is attacked by ‘cheese flies’,the Piophilia casei,which lay their eggs inside the cheese. The larvae feed off the cheese itself for around 2 weeks. The enzymes produced by the larvae favour the cheese’s fermentation and give it its final shape. The resulting cheese contains hundreds of tiny worms delivering a unique flavor to the food product.""

There are two primary techniques for making kvass: one involves using stale sourdough bread,while the other utilizes malt as the main raw material. The end product of kvass contains carbohydrates,proteins,and amino acids,as well as lactic and acetic acids,and vitamins derived from the raw materials or produced during the microbial fermentation process. Kvass is considered non-alcoholic,but it might still have up to about 1% alcohol after the fermentation process. 	rye,barley	rye and barley malt,rye flour,stale rye bread	Dlusskaya,E.,Jänsch,A.,Schwab,C.,& Gänzle,M.

In the traditional native Hawaiian diet,poi is made by first steaming taro corms which are then peeled,mashed,and mixed with a small amount of water to form a smooth paste. Raw taro corms are generally not edible due to their high oxalate content that can cause intense burning sensations in the mouth and throat,but heating reduces oxalate levels and increases palatability. Poi produced from cooked corms is thick and starchy.	taro root	taro corms		Wikipedia contributors. (2023,October 11). Poi (food). Wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poi_(food)

Unlike other beer styles,sahti beers do not necessarily include hops as an essential ingredient,and they tend to be more sweet than bitter. Sahti wort is prepared using malted barley combined with malted or unmalted rye grains (typically comprising about 10% of the grain bill) and sometimes wheat or oats are also used. The process of malting and mashing for sahti production has traditionally taken place in domestic saunas,which provide some temperature control and the necessary facilities for boiling water. Another unique aspect of sahti brewing is that the wort is not boiled,making it susceptible to microbial contamination,which to some extent hinders its commercialization."	barley,rye,wheat,oat	malted barley along with malted or unmalted grains of rye (typically ~10% of the grain bill) and sometimes also wheat or oats	Ekberg,J.,Gibson,B.,Joensuu,Krogerus,K.,Magalhães,F.,Mikkelson,A.,Seppänen‐Laakso,T.,& Wilpola,A.

Stinky tofu is made from soybeans that are rich in protein which are converted into amino acids during the fermentation process. Additionally,it contains vitamin B12. The preparation of stinky tofu involves soaking regular tofu in a specially fermented brine for varying periods,ranging from several hours to several days. This fermentation process imparts the tofu with its distinct and flavorful characteristics. To create the fermented brine,a mixture of tempeh,shiitake mushrooms,amaranth,bamboo shoots,and other edible plants is combined with water and left to naturally ferment for several months to even up to 3 years.	soybean	soybean	Tian,H.,Zou,L.,Li,Chen,C.,Yu,Ma,X.,Huang,J.,Lou,& Yuan,H.

To produce it,Baltic herring  is salted for 1-2days in a salty solution and continuously stirred for the first 4h. Then the fish is deheaded and gutted,put into barrels with a weaker brine (17% salt). The barrels are sealed,rotated occasionally for the first days and then stored at 15-18°C for 3-4 weeks. After the fermentation the fish are canned with the brine of the barrels.

Europe	Southern Europe		Greece	300	fermented cereal	Trahana		Trahana is based on a fermented mixture of grain and yoghurt or fermented milk,and found in the cuisines of Southeast Europe and the Middle East. It is predominantly produced using wheat flour and a curd obtained through lactic acid fermentation of cow,sheep,or goat milk. The traditional methods of preparation follow two primary approaches. In the first method,raw milk spontaneously ferments,and the resulting curd rises and separates from the liquid. The whey volume after separation is typically about 1/2 to 3/5 of the initial milk volume. This curd is then combined with an equal amount of wheat flour and can optionally undergo additional fermentation. If no further fermentation is carried out,the mixture is shaped into pieces,placed on trays,and dried in the sunlight. There are multiple different variations of the name,depending on the language and the region where it is produced. 	sheep milk,goat milk,cow milk,wheat	sheep,goat,cow milk,wheat flour	"Soni,S.,& Dey,G.

This is a by-product occurring during the production of ewes’ lump cheese; whey from ewes’ milk is heated to 90–95 °C with continuous shaking. At this temperature,the proteins in the whey start coagulating and they locate on the surface of the whey. After the coagulation finishes,the proteins are skimmed from the surface and cooled to acidifying temperature (50 °C). After some further shaking,the vessel is kept covered up until next day to acidify the product at least to pH 5.2. High-quality “žinčica” has to be lightly acid,and sufficiently cooled,and it should have a delicious lactic acid taste similar to that of ewes’ milk. 	sheep milk	sheep milk whey	"Lauková,A.,Kandričáková,Bino,E. et al.
